# LW Template #

Very simple templating for PHP written 10 years ago by John Winans.

## Notes ##

There are _many_ other libraries out that provide much better templating functionality for PHP now.  This repository is here to keep track of my changes related to support of XenoCMS running on the [Linear Collidor Collaboration][2] website.  XenoCMS is a proprietary CMS written by [Xeno Media][1] ~10 years ago.  It is still used by a few other sites that I know of; [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory][3], [Interactions.org][4].
